Modern preprocessing tools must evolve to integrate seamlessly with downstream analysis platforms, ensuring efficient and streamlined workflows.

Developed through an open-source, community-driven approach, xcms has maintained long-term stability while continuously expanding its capabilities and accessibility. We present recent advancements that position xcms as a central component of a modular and interoperable software ecosystem for metabolomics data analysis.

These developments empower users to build comprehensive, customizable, and reproducible workflows tailored to diverse experimental designs and analytical needs. An expanding collection of tutorials, documentation, and teaching materials further supports both new and experienced users in leveraging the broader R and Bioconductor ecosystems.

We present an ecosystem of R packages, centered around the {MetaboCoreUtils}, {MetaboAnnotation} and {CompoundDb} packages that together provide a modular infrastructure for the annotation of untargeted metabolomics data. Initial annotation can be performed based on {MS}1 properties such as m/z and retention times, followed by an {MS}2-based annotation in which experimental fragment spectra are compared against a reference library. Such reference databases can be created and managed with the {CompoundDb} package. The ecosystem supports data from a variety of formats, including, but not limited to, {MSP}, {MGF}, {mzML}, {mzXML}, {netCDF} as well as {MassBank} text files and {SQL} databases. Through its highly customizable functionality, the presented infrastructure allows to build reproducible annotation workflows tailored for and adapted to most untargeted {LC}-{MS}-based datasets. All core functionality, which supports base R data types, is exported, also facilitating its re-use in other R packages. Finally, all packages are thoroughly unit-tested and documented and are available on {GitHub} and through Bioconductor.},

Determining the boundaries, centres and intensities of the two-dimensional signals in the LC/MS raw data is called feature detection. For the subsequent analysis of complex samples such as plant extracts, which may contain hundreds of compounds, corresponding to thousands of features -- a reliable feature detection is mandatory.RESULTS:We developed a new feature detection algorithm centWave for high-resolution LC/MS data sets, which collects regions of interest (partial mass traces) in the raw-data, and applies continuous wavelet transformation and optionally Gauss-fitting in the chromatographic domain. We evaluated our feature detection algorithm on dilution series and mixtures of seed and leaf extracts, and estimated recall, precision and F-score of seed and leaf specific features in two experiments of different complexity.CONCLUSION:The new feature detection algorithm meets the requirements of current metabolomics experiments. centWave can detect close-by and partially overlapping features and has the highest overall recall and precision values compared to the other algorithms, matchedFilter (the original algorithm of XCMS) and the centroidPicker from MZmine. The centWave algorithm was integrated into the Bioconductor R-package XCMS and is available from (http://www.bioconductor.org/).},

To date, dozens of correspondence algorithms have been proposed, creating a daunting challenge for practitioners in algorithm selection. Yet, existing reviews have highlighted only a few approaches. In this review, we describe 50 correspondence algorithms to facilitate practical algorithm selection. We elucidate the motivation for correspondence and analyze the limitations of current approaches, which include prohibitive runtimes, numerous user parameters, model limitations and the need for reference samples.

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              With the growth of metabolomics research, more and more studies are conducted on large numbers of samples. Due to technical limitations of the Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) platform, samples often need to be processed in multiple batches. Across different batches, we often observe differences in data characteristics. In this work, we specifically focus on data generated in multiple batches on the same LC/MS machinery. Traditional preprocessing methods treat all samples as a single group. Such practice can result in errors in the alignment of peaks, which cannot be corrected by post hoc application of batch effect correction methods. In this work, we developed a new approach that address the batch effect issue in the preprocessing stage, resulting in better peak detection, alignment and quantification. It can be combined with down-stream batch effect correction methods to further correct for between-batch intensity differences. The method is implemented in the existing workflow of the apLCMS platform. Analyzing data with multiple batches, both generated from standardized quality control (QC) plasma samples and from real biological studies, the new method resulted in feature tables with better consistency, as well as better down-stream analysis results. The method can be a useful addition to the tools available for large studies involving multiple batches. The method is available as part of the apLCMS package. Download link and instructions are at

	abstract = {High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) in full scan mode acquires all ions present in the sample of interest offering a lot of qualitative information. This, in combination with the improved performance of the new generation HRMS systems, triggers more (bio) analysts to switch from triple quad MS systems to HRMS for quantitative analysis. Quantitative processing of HRMS data is performed based on narrow mass extraction windows rather than on nominal mass product ion chromatograms (SRM or MRM). Optimal processing of HRMS data requires different considerations and software tools and can have an impact on data processing and final results. The selection of centroid versus continuum/profile data for processing, selection of the optimal narrow mass extraction window, using theoretical versus measured accurate mass for the extraction of the ion chromatograms as well as differences in calculations and data handling residing in the different vendor software packages are tackled in the presented manuscript. These differences are illustrated on HRMS data acquired for the same plasma samples on three different platforms, i.e., a Sciex QToF, a Waters QToF, and a Thermo Orbitrap system, and processed in four different software packages, i.e., Sciex Analyst® TF, Waters Masslynx, Waters Unifi, and Thermo Xcalibur. The impact of these differences on quantitative HRMS performance was evaluated on calibration curves of eight small molecule compounds in plasma using four different ways of processing. Simple guidelines are provided for the selection of an optimal mass extraction window for continuum and centroided data.},

However, in the current study, we have found that under the same LC-MS conditions, the Rt. and shape of LC-peaks of bile acids in urine samples from animals fed dissimilar diets differed significantly among each other. To verify this matrix effect, 17 authentic bile acid standards were dissolved in pure methanol or in methanol containing extracts of urine from pigs consuming either breast milk or infant formula and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The matrix components in urine from piglets fed formula significantly reduced the LC-peak Rt. and areas of bile acids. This is the first characterization of this matrix effect on Rt. in the literature. Moreover, the matrix effect resulted in an unexpected LC behavior: one single compound yielded two LC-peaks, which broke the rule of one LC-peak for one compound. The three bile acid standards which exhibited this unconventional LC behavior were chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and glycocholic acid. One possible explanation for this effect is that some matrix components may have loosely bonded to analytes, which changed the time analytes were retained on a chromatography column and interfered with the ionization of analytes in the MS ion source to alter the peak area. This study indicates that a comprehensive understanding of matrix effects is needed towards improving the use of HPLC and LC-MS/MS techniques for qualitative and quantitative analyses of analytes in pharmacokinetics, proteomics/metabolomics, drug development, and sports drug testing, especially when LC-MS/MS data are analyzed by automation software where identification of an analyte is based on its exact molecular weight and Rt.},
