	abstract = {Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS})-based untargeted metabolomics experiments have become increasingly popular because of the wide range of metabolites that can be analyzed and the possibility to measure novel compounds. {LC}-{MS} instrumentation and analysis conditions can differ substantially among laboratories and experiments, thus resulting in non-standardized datasets demanding customized annotation workflows. We present an ecosystem of R packages, centered around the {MetaboCoreUtils}, {MetaboAnnotation} and {CompoundDb} packages that together provide a modular infrastructure for the annotation of untargeted metabolomics data. Initial annotation can be performed based on {MS}1 properties such as m/z and retention times, followed by an {MS}2-based annotation in which experimental fragment spectra are compared against a reference library. Such reference databases can be created and managed with the {CompoundDb} package. The ecosystem supports data from a variety of formats, including, but not limited to, {MSP}, {MGF}, {mzML}, {mzXML}, {netCDF} as well as {MassBank} text files and {SQL} databases. Through its highly customizable functionality, the presented infrastructure allows to build reproducible annotation workflows tailored for and adapted to most untargeted {LC}-{MS}-based datasets. All core functionality, which supports base R data types, is exported, also facilitating its re-use in other R packages. Finally, all packages are thoroughly unit-tested and documented and are available on {GitHub} and through Bioconductor.},
